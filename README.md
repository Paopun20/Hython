# Hython Interpreter

Hython is a Python-inspired scripting interpreter written in Haxe.

It provides a dynamic, embeddable scripting runtime with Python-like semantics,
designed for use in Haxe projects such as games, tools, and modding environments
(e.g. Friday Night Funkin' Psych Engine forks).

Hython is **not a full Python implementation**. Instead, it focuses on:
- Dynamic typing and expressions
- Functions and closures
- Control flow (if, for, while, break, continue, return)
- Map and array literals
- Safe embedding and sandbox-friendly design

This makes Hython suitable as a lightweight scripting language rather than a
drop-in replacement for CPython.
