# Hython Documentation

Welcome to the Hython documentation! Hython is a Python-inspired scripting interpreter built on Haxe, designed for embeddable and sandboxable game scripting.

## What is Hython?

Hython brings Python-style syntax and semantics to the Haxe ecosystem. It's a lightweight, dynamic scripting language that integrates seamlessly with Haxe projects—making it perfect for:

- **Game scripting** (e.g., modding frameworks like Psych Engine)
- **Modular code execution** within larger Haxe applications
- **Sandboxed scripting** where you need a safer, isolated execution environment
- **Python developers** transitioning to Haxe-based systems

## Key Features

✨ **Python-style syntax** – Familiar colons, indentation-based blocks  
🎯 **Dynamic typing** – No compile-time type constraints  
🔧 **Embeddable** – Integrate into your Haxe projects easily  
🛡️ **Sandbox-friendly** – Safe, controlled script execution  
⚡ **Lightweight** – Minimal overhead, maximum flexibility  

## Quick Navigation

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** – Installation and basic usage
- **[Language Guide](language-guide.md)** – Syntax, features, and examples
- **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** – Complete API documentation
- **[Examples](examples.md)** – Real-world usage examples
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** – How Hython works under the hood

## What Hython Is NOT

Hython is **not a full Python implementation**. It focuses on core features and syntax rather than mimicking every Python library and behavior. For advanced Python features, consider:

- Using actual Python with `PythonExecutor` for heavy lifting
- Implementing custom Haxe extensions for specific needs

## Getting Help

- Check the [Language Guide](language-guide.md) for syntax questions
- Browse [Examples](examples.md) for common patterns
- Review the [Architecture](architecture.md) for deeper understanding
- Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Paopun20/Hython) for bugs or features
